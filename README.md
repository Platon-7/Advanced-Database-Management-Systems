# Advanced-Database-Management-Systems

This course is part of the Computer Science Masters program of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, where I studied during the spring semester of 2022.
The course's study material was scientific papers and the project was to choose 10 out of the total 19 papers and summarize them.
